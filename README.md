# F.R.I.E.N.D.S

API to watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S (one episode a day)

### What is this?

This in a API which returns url to F.R.I.E.N.D.S episodes

### Why did you build it?

I was binge watching right before my FAT exams, so before any harm was done I tried to avert it by building this API

### What does it do?

It keeps track of when the last request was made, it only returns a url once every 24 hours.

### Did it help?

F.R.I.E.N.D.S is too good,i ended up binging through 3 seasons during my FAT exams

### So it didnt work?

Well if the person using it had a miniscule amount of self control this app would work flawlessly.

### Cant you just bookmark the site where you watch the episodes?

This API automatically changes episodes and also the season everytime it returns the last episode,so ijust need to
Call this API and it would do the rest
